1998-10-28  Sean M. Burke  sburke@netadventure.net

	* Release 0.74 -- whoops, forgot to bundle the README.
	No change in the module.

1998-11-03  Sean M. Burke  sburke@netadventure.net

	* Release 0.75 -- minor changes:

	New methods new_daughter, new_daughter_left.

	$obj->new constructor syntax now documented.
	
	Internal accesses to "daughter" and "mother" attribs
	are now direct, for efficiency's sake.

	Minor improvements to the docs.

1999-05-14  Sean M. Burke  sburke@netadventure.net

        * Releass 1.01 -- major additions:
	
	Scads of new methods.  Still (as far as I know) backward
	compatible with all previous versions.  Some minor changes in
	coding, not affecting the interface.

	Hopefully more friendly to users that use -w (warnings).

	Cautionary tale: I started making big changes to this right around
	mid-November 1998.  But I kept thinking "oh, ONE MORE change and
	then I'll release it."  Famous last words!  Other things came up,
	I forgot what was new and what was different in this module
	(which is why you don't see a detailed list of differences here),
	altho apparently somehow I managed to document all the new
	methods.
