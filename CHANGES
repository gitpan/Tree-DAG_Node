Revision history for Perl module Tree::DAG_Node.

1.11  Mon Feb  4 09:50:00 2013
	- Correct the date (2012 -> 2013) in this file used for V 1.10.
	- Correct the text at L<Tree::DAG_Node/AUTHOR> so it refers to Artistic License 2.0,
		which now matches what it says in Build.PL and Makefile.PL. Resolves RT#83088.

1.10  Fri Feb  1 08:53:00 2013
	- Change t/pod.t to look for Test::Pod 1.45, but comment out Test::Pod in Build.PL and Makefile.PL.
		This means Test::Pod is not used at all if it is not installed. As per RT#83077.

1.09  Thu Nov  8 12:38:00 2012
	- No code changes.
	- Oops. The changes in V 1.08 we made in the other 10 distros, but not in this one. My apologies.

1.08  Thu Nov  8 12:38:00 2012
	- No code changes.
	- For pre-reqs such as strict, warnings, etc, which ship with Perl, set the version # to 0.
		Reported as RT#80663 by Father Chrysostomos for Tree::DAG_Node.

1.07  Thu Nov  1 12:47:00 2012
	- New maintainer: Ron Savage
	- Pre-emptive apologies for any changes which are not back-compat. No such problems are expected, but the
		introduction of new methods may disconcert some viewers.
	- Fix RT#78858, reported by Gene Boggs. Audit code for similar problems.
	- Fix RT#79506. reported by Ron Savage.
	- Rename ChangeLog to CHANGES, and add Changelog.ini.
	- Replace all uses of cyclicity_fault() and Carp::croak with die.
	- Remove unused methods: decommission_root(), cyclicity_allowed(), cyclicity_fault(), inaugurate_root(),
		no_cyclicity() and _update_links(). OK - cyclicity_fault() was called once. It just died.
	- Add methods: format_node(), hashref2string(), is_root(), node2string(), tree2string().
		tree2string($opts, $node) - unlike draw_ascii_tree() - can optionally print the tree starting at any node.
		Override format_node(), hashref2string(), and node2string() if desired.
	- Reformat the POD big-time.
	- Add Build.PL.
	- Re-write Makefile.PL.
	- Remove use vars(@ISA $Debug $VERSION). Replace latter 2 with 'our ...'.
	- Rename t/00_about_verbose.t to t/about.perl.t.
	- Add scripts/cut.and.paste.subtrees.pl. Warning: Some trees get into an infinite loop.
	- Add t/cut.and.paste.subtrees.t.        Warning: Some trees get into an infinite loop.
	- Document the options (discouraged by Sean) supported in the call to new($hashref).

1.06  Sun Dec  2 12:00:00 1998
	- New maintainer: David Hand.
	- No code changes.

1.05  Wed Dec 29 12:00:00 1998
	- Just repackaging.
	- No code changes.

1.04  Fri Feb 23 12:00:00 1998
	- Bugfix: Olegt@dreamtime.net notes a bug in
		depth_under that apparently always makes it return 0.

1.03  Sat May 13 12:00:00 1998
	- Superficial changes:
		Minor doc spiffing-up.
		Noting my new email address.
	- In order to keep its symbol table clean, DAG_Node no longer
		imports routines from Carp and UNIVERSAL.  Should have no effect on existing code.
	- I went and commented out all the places where I have asserts for
		non-cyclicity.  I once had the idea that DAG_Node could be a base
		class for graphs that /could/ allow cyclicity, or something like
		that, so those assertions would apply for methods that work only
		for acyclic networks.  But, in time, I realized that almost
		everything in DAG_Node would have to have such assertions.  Moral
		of the story: DAG_Node has nearly no code that it could share with
		a class for anything but DAGs.  And since DAG_Node does everything it
		can to /keep/ you from making cyclicities, there's no point in
		constantly having assertions of noncyclicity (especially when
		these assertions are rather expensive to check).

1.02  Sun Mar  05 12:00:00 1998
	- Minor bugfixes:
		Fixed a typo in the docs: corrected one "right_sisters" to "right_sister"
		Initialized a variable to '' to avoid warnings under -w. Thanks to Gilles Lamiral.

1.01  Fri May 14 12:00:00 1998
	- Major additions:
		Scads of new methods.  Still (as far as I know) backward
		compatible with all previous versions.  Some minor changes in
		coding, not affecting the interface.
	- Hopefully more friendly to users that use -w (warnings).
	- Cautionary tale: I started making big changes to this right around
		mid-November 1998.  But I kept thinking "oh, ONE MORE change and
		then I'll release it."  Famous last words!  Other things came up,
		I forgot what was new and what was different in this module
		(which is why you don't see a detailed list of differences here),
		altho apparently somehow I managed to document all the new methods.

0.75  Tue Nov  3 12:00:00 1998
	- Minor changes:
		New methods new_daughter, new_daughter_left.
		$obj->new constructor syntax now documented.
		Internal accesses to "daughter" and "mother" attribs are now direct, for efficiency's sake.
	- Minor improvements to the docs.

0.74  Wed Oct 28 12:00:00 1998
	- Whoops, forgot to bundle the README.
	- No change in the code.

0.73  Tue Oct 27 12:00:00 1998
	- First release.
